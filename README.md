## Edit the documentation

git clone https://github.com/openfoodfacts/api-documentation
git checkout -b <DOC_FIX_BRANCH_NAME>
```

### Edit the collection with Postman

* Open Postman
* Click "Import" then "Folder" and browse to this repository's folder.
* Postman collection and environment located in the repo will be imported in your Postman application.
* Edit the collection using the application, and once you're done click "Export"
* Rename the file as `off-pm-collection.json`
* Save it (overwrite the original one)

### Push to git

Now it's time to propose your changes as a pull request on the repository. We're going to make a branch and commit our updated `off-pm-collection.json`.

Run:

git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>
git add off-pm-collection.json
git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"`
