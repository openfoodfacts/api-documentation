# Documentation of the Open Food Facts API

The new version of the documentation is available here: 
- Stable version of the doc: https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation/
- Staging version of the doc: https://openfoodfacts.github.io/api-documentation-staging/

We have an older version available on the Wiki.

- https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Documentation

# Tests
- Note: This documentation is actually able to run API tests, that will fail if not properly specified or if the API has changed, and the documentation has not. Currently, around 20 tests are failing.

# Roadmap

We need documentation maintainers
- [ ] to document new features (Eco-Score, Attributesâ€¦)
- [ ] to improve existing documents based on feedback and questions in the #api channel
